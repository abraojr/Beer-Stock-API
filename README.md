# Beer-Stock-API
<h2>Digital Innovation One: Project to Bootcamp - Development of unit tests to validate a REST API for beer stocks management</h2>


In this project a REST API for beer stock management was developed, with a focus on unit testing. Main frameworks used for unit tests: JUnit, Mockito and Hamcrest. Unit tests were created to validate the basic functionalities: creation, listing, query by name, and exclusion of beers.In the end, two important functionalities were developed using the TDD concept: functionalities to increment and decrement the number of beers in stock.
